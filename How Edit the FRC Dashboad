How to Edit the FRC Dashboard (All the steps are windows specific)

Open LabVeiw.
Create a new dashboard project.
Give it a name (That makes sense).
A smaller window called project explorer will pop up.
Double click on Dashboard main.vi
A bigger window that is your dashboard will pop up.
Next to that window is one with all the stuff you can put in the tabs.
Make the changes necessary.
When youâ€™re done, in the project explore window, under build specifications, right click FRC_Dashboard.
Click build.
Click explore.
Find the build file and copy it to c:/program files/FRC Dashboard.
Inside c:/users/public/public documents/FRC, open FRC DS Data storage.
Change the Dashboardcmd line from dashboard.exe to the name of your build file
It will hopefully run.
For additional help, ask the coding lead or anyone with experience doing this.
